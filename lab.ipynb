      "Mistral AI, a European AI startup, has introduced two new large language models, Mistral Large and Mistral Small, joining their previously released Mistral Medium. These models are fluent in multiple European languages and have achieved impressive benchmark scores, outperforming several competitors. Microsoft has invested in Mistral AI, and the two companies will collaborate to train bespoke models for customers, including European governments. This partnership has sparked debate among European lawmakers and regulators, as it provides Mistral AI with significant processing power and access to potential markets but also raises concerns about Microsoft's influence.\n",
